  "Sure, here's a shanty:\n\n(Verse 1)\nThe sun shines bright upon the waves,\nAnd the wind blows wild and free,\nThe waves crash high upon the shore,\nAnd the sea gulls sing their song.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, the sea shanty's a joyful sound,\nA tale of old and a tale of new,\nIn the ocean's embrace,\nWe sing to ease the day's plight.\n\n("]]
